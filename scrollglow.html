       people say there was a primordial explosion, an enormous bang billions of years ago which flung all the galaxies into space. Well let’s take that just for the sake of argument and say that was the way it happened. It’s like you took a bottle of ink and you threw it at a wall. </div></section>
      
       
        <div class="hoverHere text">
      <span class="Smash">Smash!</span> 
    </div></section>
      
        <section><div class="hoverHere text">
          And all that ink spread. And in the middle, it’s dense, isn’t it? And as it gets out on the edge, the little droplets get <span class="finer">finer and </span><span class="finest">finer and make more </span><span class="MostFine">complicated patterns, see?</span>
     </div></section>
      
        <section><div class="hoverHere text">
          So in the same way, there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread. And you and I, sitting here in this room, as complicated human beings, are way, way out on the fringe of that bang. We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it. Very interesting.
     </div></section>
      
        
  
  <section><div class="hoverHere text">But so we define ourselves as being only that. If you think that you are only inside your skin, you define yourself as one very complicated little curlicue, way out on the edge of that explosion. Way out in space, and way out in time.</div></section>

  <section><div class="hoverHere text">
Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you’re a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don’t feel that we’re still the big bang.
  </div></section>

   <section><div class="hoverHere shake">
But you are.
  </div></section>

   <section><div class="hoverHere text">
Depends how you define yourself. You are actually–if this is the way things started, if there was a big bang in the beginning– you’re not something that’s a result of the big bang. You’re not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process.
  </div></section>
   <section><div class="hoverHere text">
 You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are. When I meet you, I see not just what you define yourself as–Mr so-and- so, Ms so-and-so, Mrs so-and-so–I see every one of you as the primordial energy of the universe coming on at me in this particular way.
  </div></section>

  </h2>
   <section><div class="hoverHere text">
 I know I’m that, too. But we’ve learned to define ourselves as separate from it… In other words, when you really start to see things, and you look at an old paper cup, and you go into the nature of what it is to see what vision is, or what smell is, or what touch is, you realize that that vision of the paper cup is the brilliant light of the cosmos.

   <section><div class="hoverHere bright">Nothing could be brighter. Ten thousand suns couldn’t be brighter.
  </div></section>

   <section><div class="hoverHere text">
Only they’re hidden in the sense that all the points of the infinite light are so tiny when you see them in the cup they don’t blow your eyes out.
  </div></section>
   <section><div class="hoverHere text">
See, the source of all light is in the eye. If there were no eyes in this world, the sun would not be light. So if I hit as hard as I can on a drum which has no skin, it makes no noise. So if a sun shines on a world with no eyes, it’s like a hand beating on a skinless drum. No light.
  </div></section>

<section><div class="hoverHere text">
YOU evoke light out of the universe, in the same way you, by nature of having a soft skin, evoke hardness out of wood. Wood is only hard in relation to a soft skin. It’s your eardrum that evokes noise out of the air. 
  </div></section>

<section><div class="hoverHere text">
You, by being this organism, call into being this whole universe of light and color and hardness and heaviness and everything…
